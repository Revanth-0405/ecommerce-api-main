# E-Commerce Inventory & Orders API


### Project Overview

A production-style RESTful backend API that manages products, inventory, and orders for an e-commerce system.

This project demonstrates real backend engineering principles used in industry systems:
* Secure API key authentication
* Role-based access control
* Atomic multi-resource transactions
* Concurrency-safe inventory update
* Hybrid SQL + NoSQL architecture
* Request rate limiting
* Reporting analytics
* Automated testing
* Containerized deployment

This is designed to reflect real backend system architecture, not a tutorial project.

# System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:
```
Client Request
      ↓
Routes Layer
      ↓
Service Layer
      ↓
Database Models
      ↓
Storage Layer
```
### Why this design?

* clean separation of concerns
* scalable code structure
* testable business logic
* maintainable modules

# Authentication System

### Protected endpoints require:
```
X-API-Key: <your-api-key>
```
### Keys are:
* securely hashed
* role-restricted
* revocable
* rate limited

---

# Feature Set

### Authentication
*Generate API keys
*Role permissions (Admin / Viewer)

### Product Management
*Create products
*Update products
*Soft delete
*Stock adjustment
*Full-text search support

### Order Processing
* Create orders
* Atomic stock deduction
* Transaction safety
* Cancel order (stock restoration)
* Status workflow enforcement
* pending → confirmed → shipped
* Invalid transitions are automatically rejected.

---

# Reporting APIs
* Low stock report
* Sales summary
* Top selling products

---

# Security Features
* SHA256 key hashing
* Role authorization
* Rate limiting
* Input validation
* Transaction integrity
* Thread-safe operations

---
